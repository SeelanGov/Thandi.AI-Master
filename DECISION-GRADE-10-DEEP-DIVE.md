# Decision: Grade 10 Deep Assessment

**Date:** November 24, 2025  
**Status:** AWAITING YOUR APPROVAL  
**Timeline:** 3 days (Nov 25-27) if approved

---

## The Question

Should Grade 10 students get a deep 10-question assessment, or stick with the current 4 questions?

---

## Your Cofounder's Answer

**Yes, but make it opt-in.**

Grade 10 students need deep guidance (subject choices lock in career paths), but they're younger and less urgent. Prove value first with a quick report, then offer the deep dive.

## Recommended Solution

**Adaptive Assessment:**

| Grade | Experience |
|-------|------------|
| **Grade 10** | 4 questions → Quick report → "Want 3-year plan?" (optional) |
| **Grade 11-12** | 4 questions → Auto-advance → 10 questions → Full report |

**The Psychology:**
- Grade 10: "Is this worth my time?" → Prove value first
- Grade 11-12: "I need help NOW" → They're already committed

## The Value Difference

**4-question output:**
> "Based on your marks, consider Engineering."

**10-question output:**
> "You enjoy Physics (60%) but struggle with Math (45%). For Engineering, you need Math 70%+ by Grade 12.
> 
> **Your 3-Year Action Plan:**
> - Grade 10: Get tutoring, aim for 55%+
> - Grade 11: Join study group, target 65%+
> - Grade 12: Maintain 70%+, apply for Sasol bursary
> 
> **Alternative:** If Math doesn't improve, consider Engineering Technology
> 
> **This Week:** Talk to Math teacher, research Sasol bursary"

**The difference:** Student knows exactly what to do tomorrow.

## Why This Sequence

1. **Rule #4 first** = Protects vulnerable students NOW
2. **Deep dive second** = Makes guidance more accurate TOMORROW
3. **Together** = Low-income Grade 10 gets affordable career + 3-year plan

Aligns with your "no rush" philosophy while building the right foundation.

## The Core Question

> "Do we want Thandi to be a toy (quick, fun, shallow) or a tool (deep, actionable, trusted)?"

Your vision: *"Ensure they can maintain the marks and become better people."*

**That's a tool, not a toy.**
