Test it: https://thandiai.vercel.app/assessment

Rate 1-10 (be BRUTAL):
1. Personalized to YOU?
2. Trustworthy advice?
3. Can you see YOUR marks?

Yes/No: Would friends finish this?

Need numbers by 8 AM.
```

**DO NOT ADD EXPLANATIONS. NUMBERS ONLY.**

## 🔥 REMINDER

The deep dive works. The RAG works. The personalization works.

Students just couldn't SEE it.

Now they can.

Tomorrow we find out if it's enough.
