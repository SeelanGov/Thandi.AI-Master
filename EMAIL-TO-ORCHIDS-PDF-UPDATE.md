**Subject:** PDF Generation Update - Improved Formatting (Action Required)

---

Hi Orchids Team,

Quick update on the PDF download feature we discussed earlier.

## What Happened

We tested the PDF generation and found a **formatting issue** - the text was running together without proper line breaks, making it hard to read. We've fixed this and deployed the improved version.

## What Changed

**Before:** All text in one continuous block  
**After:** Proper headings, numbered lists, bullet points, and spacing

See the difference:
- Headings are now bold and larger
- Numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) are properly indented
- Bullet points use proper • symbols
- Paragraphs have spacing between them

## Action for You

### If you haven't implemented PDF yet:
✅ No action needed - just use the updated code in our integration guide

### If you already implemented PDF:
⚠️ Please update your code with the improved version

**Where to find it:**
- Document: `ORCHIDS-PDF-INTEGRATION.md`
- Look for: "Step 2: Add PDF Generation Function (UPDATED)"

## Testing

After updating, please test with a sample career guidance response and verify:
- Headings are bold
- Lists are indented
- Bullet points show properly
- Text doesn't run together

## Timeline

- **This week:** Update your code (if already implemented)
- **Before pilot:** Ensure all PDFs use improved formatting

## Need Help?

Let us know if you:
- Need sample responses for testing
- Have questions about the code
- Want to use our API endpoint instead (we can handle PDF generation server-side)

## Documents Attached

1. `ORCHIDS-PDF-UPDATE-NOV22.md` - Detailed explanation of changes
2. `ORCHIDS-PDF-INTEGRATION.md` - Updated integration guide with new code

Thanks for your partnership on this!

Best,
