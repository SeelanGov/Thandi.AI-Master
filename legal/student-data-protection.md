## OVERVIEW

Thandi.ai is currently in **beta testing** with South African schools. These guidelines ensure maximum protection for student data during our pilot phase and comply with POPIA and the South African Schools Act.

---

## FOR SCHOOLS PARTICIPATING IN BETA

### 1. INFORMED CONSENT REQUIREMENTS

Before allowing student access, schools **must** obtain documented consent:

**For Students 18+ (Matric/Post-matric):**
- Signed consent form acknowledging:
- Beta status and potential inaccuracies
- Data collection purposes (subjects, marks, interests)
- Right to withdraw consent anytime
- How to request data deletion
- Independent verification requirement

**For Students Under 18 (Grades 8-11):**
- **PARENT/GUARDIAN SIGNATURE REQUIRED** (non-negotiable)
- Separate age-appropriate consent form
- School acts as intermediary and consent verifier
- Form must be explained in parent's home language if needed
- **Template available:** Email hello@thandi.online with subject "School Consent Template"

### 2. SCHOOL OBLIGATIONS

By participating in the beta program, schools agree to:
- **Appoint a staff coordinator** as single point of contact
- **Verify consent** for all participating students before providing access codes
- **Distribute parent information letters** (available in English, isiZulu, Afrikaans, Xhosa)
- **Provide emergency contact** for technical issues during school hours
- **Report concerns** within 48 hours of discovery
- **Facilitate data deletion requests** from parents/students
- **Participate in feedback survey** at end of 4-week pilot

### 3. SUPERVISION RECOMMENDATIONS

**For first-time use, we strongly recommend:**
- Teacher-facilitated session in computer lab/classroom
- Brief 5-minute orientation on how AI recommendations work
- Emphasize: *"This is a guide, not gospel - verify everything"*
- Encourage discussion of results with school counselor
- Discuss digital literacy and critical thinking around AI tools

**Sample teacher script available** on request.

### 4. DATA MINIMIZATION (BETA PHASE)

We limit collection to **only what is necessary**:
- ✅ Subjects and marks (minimum for accuracy)
- ✅ Grade level (not full birthdate)
- ✅ Career interests (categorical, not free text)
- ❌ **NOT collected:** ID numbers, physical addresses, race (unless for bursary matching with explicit consent), medical info, family income

**Schools should not provide any student data directly to us** - students enter their own information.

## FOR STUDENTS & PARENTS

### WHAT WE COLLECT & WHY

| Data Type | Why We Need It | How Long We Keep It | Can Delete? |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Subject marks | Calculate admission eligibility | 12 months | ✅ Yes |
| Career interests | Personalize recommendations | 12 months | ✅ Yes |
| Grade level | Show age-appropriate options | 12 months | ✅ Yes |
| Email address | Send results securely | Until you delete account | ✅ Yes |
| School name | Improve regional accuracy | Anonymized after 12 months | ⚠️ Partial |

### YOUR PROTECTIONS

✅ **No commercial use** of your data during beta  
✅ **Independent verification** warnings on every recommendation  
✅ **Immediate deletion** upon request (email: hello@thandi.online)  
✅ **Anonymized participation** in research (opt-out available)  
✅ **Secure storage** on encrypted Vercel/Google servers  
✅ **No third-party selling** - ever  
✅ **B-BBEE status protected** - we are a 100% black-owned Level 1 contributor

### WHAT TO VERIFY INDEPENDENTLY

⚠️ **CRITICAL BETA DISCLAIMERS:**
- **University admission requirements change annually** - Always check official prospectuses on university websites
- **Bursary deadlines and criteria** - Confirm directly with bursary providers (many change mid-year)
- **Career paths** - May have additional requirements: medical tests, portfolios, driver's license, security clearance
- **Marks calculations** - Some universities use different weightings (e.g., dropping lowest subject)
- **Use Thandi.ai as a starting point, not final authority**

**Verification guide included** with every student report.

### PARENT/GUARDIAN RIGHTS

Parents/guardians of students under 18 can:
- **Request access** to all data collected about their child (within 7 days)
- **Request deletion** of all data immediately
- **Request data export** in portable format
- **Object to school participation** in beta program
- **Withdraw consent** mid-program (student access will be deactivated)
- **Complain to Information Regulator** if rights are violated

**To exercise rights:** Email hello@thandi.online with subject: "Parent Request - [Student Name] - [School Name]"
