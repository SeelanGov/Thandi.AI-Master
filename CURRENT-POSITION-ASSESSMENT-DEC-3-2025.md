## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

**Impact:** Medium - Careers are still relevant but personalization is partial  
**Fix Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Priority:** P1 (should fix before alpha testing)

### Issue 2: Timeline Slippage
**Problem:** 2 weeks behind on Nov 18-22 deliverables  
**Impact:** High - Cascades to all future milestones  
**Fix:** Need to catch up or revise timeline  
**Priority:** P0 (critical decision needed)

### Issue 3: No Testing Completed
**Problem:** System deployed but not validated with real users  
**Impact:** High - Don't know if it actually works for students  
**Fix:** Run alpha tests ASAP  
**Priority:** P0 (blocks pilot launch)

### Issue 4: Missing Content

**Impact:** Medium - Limits career recommendations  
**Fix:** Add 11 priority careers  
**Priority:** P1 (needed before pilot)

## 📈 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW

### Option A: Catch Up (Aggressive)
**Timeline:** Compress 2 weeks of work into next week

**This Week (Dec 3-7):**
- Monday-Tuesday: Pricing strategy + content audit
- Wednesday: Failure mode analysis
- Thursday-Friday: Teacher interviews (if you can schedule)

**Next Week (Dec 10-14):**
- Contractor research + decision
- Start content creation (3 careers)
- Fix profile data bug

**Pros:** Gets back on track for Jan 6 start  
**Cons:** Very aggressive, high stress  
**Risk:** Burnout, rushed decisions

### Option B: Revise Timeline (Realistic)
**Timeline:** Accept 2-week delay, push everything back

**New Milestones:**
- Jan 20 (not Jan 6): Content Sprint 1 starts
- Feb 17 (not Feb 3): Large alpha test
- Mar 17 (not Mar 3): Pilot launch

**Pros:** More realistic, less stress, better quality  
**Cons:** 2-week delay to revenue  
**Risk:** Further slippage if not disciplined

### Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)
**Timeline:** Catch up on critical path, accept delays on non-critical

**Critical Path (Must Do):**
1. Fix profile data bug (1 day)
2. Content audit (1 day)
3. Add 3 priority careers (3 days)
4. Run 10 internal alpha tests (3 days)
5. Analyze feedback (1 day)

**Non-Critical (Can Delay):**
- Pricing strategy (do in January)
- Teacher interviews (do in January)
- Contractor decision (do in January)

**New Timeline:**
- Dec 3-14: Fix bug, add content, run alpha
- Dec 15-31: Holiday break (realistic)
- Jan 6-10: Pricing + contractor + teacher prep
- Jan 13: Content Sprint 1 starts (1 week late)
- Mar 10: Pilot launch (1 week late)

**Pros:** Focuses on product quality, realistic about holidays  
**Cons:** 1-week delay to pilot  
**Risk:** Manageable if disciplined
