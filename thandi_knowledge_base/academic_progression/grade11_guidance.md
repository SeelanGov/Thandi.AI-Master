# Grade 11 Student Guidance - Academic Progression

## Overview
Grade 11 is the critical middle year of the FET phase where students have Grade 10 marks available and must focus on improving performance while planning for Grade 12 and beyond. This is the strategic planning year for university admission and career preparation.

## Academic Context
- **Phase**: Second year of Senior Phase (Grades 10-12)
- **Curriculum**: CAPS (Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement) or IEB (Independent Examinations Board)
- **Status**: Continuing student with academic track record
- **Available Marks**: Grade 10 marks from previous year
- **Subject Selection**: Locked in from Grade 10 (limited changes possible)
- **Planning Horizon**: 2-year planning for Grade 12 and university

## Key Characteristics of Grade 11 Students

### Academic Status
- **Continuing Student**: Has Grade 10 performance data available
- **Track Record**: Can analyze strengths and weaknesses from Grade 10
- **Subject Commitment**: Subject choices largely locked in (CAPS/IEB requirements)
- **Performance Focus**: Must improve marks for Grade 12 readiness

### Career Guidance Focus
1. **University Research**: Detailed investigation of university programs
2. **Mark Improvement Strategies**: Targeted improvement in weak subjects
3. **Grade 11-12 Planning**: Strategic planning for final year
4. **Subject Viability Confirmation**: Ensuring subjects support career goals

## Academic Performance Analysis

### Using Grade 10 Marks for Planning
**Grade 10 marks are crucial for Grade 11 students because they:**
- Indicate subject strengths and weaknesses
- Show academic potential and trajectory
- Help predict Grade 12 performance
- Guide university program selection
- Inform subject change decisions (if still possible)

### Performance Categories
**Strong Performance (70%+)**:
- Continue with confidence
- Aim for 75%+ in Grade 11
- Consider advanced/honors programs
- Build on these strengths for university applications

**Moderate Performance (60-69%)**:
- Focus area for improvement
- Implement targeted study strategies
- Seek additional support
- Aim for 70%+ in Grade 11

**Weak Performance (50-59%)**:
- Requires immediate intervention
- Consider subject change if possible and beneficial
- Intensive support needed
- May limit university options if not improved

**Failing Performance (<50%)**:
- Critical intervention required
- Subject change strongly recommended if possible
- Alternative pathway planning needed
- Focus on subjects where success is achievable

## Subject Change Considerations (Limited Window)

### When Subject Changes Make Sense
- **Mathematics to Mathematical Literacy**: If struggling with Mathematics and STEM careers not required
- **Physical Sciences**: If Mathematics is weak and STEM not the goal
- **Language Changes**: If struggling with current language choices
- **Elective Adjustments**: Changing between electives based on performance and interest

### Consequences of Subject Changes
**Changing from Mathematics to Mathematical Literacy**:
- ✅ More manageable math content
- ❌ Cannot take Physical Sciences
- ❌ Eliminates most STEM career options
- ❌ Limits university program choices

**Dropping Physical Sciences**:
- ✅ Reduces academic load
- ❌ Eliminates engineering, medicine, and most science careers
- ❌ Limits university STEM programs

### Subject Change Process
1. **Consult with teachers** about current performance and potential
2. **Meet with career counselor** about career implications
3. **Research university requirements** for intended programs
4. **Consider long-term consequences** carefully
5. **Make decision early in Grade 11** (limited window)

## University Research and Planning

### University Program Research
**Research Process**:
1. **Identify career interests** based on Grade 10 performance and interests
2. **Research specific programs** at different universities
3. **Understand admission requirements** (APS, subject requirements)
4. **Compare program content** and career outcomes
5. **Consider practical factors** (location, cost, duration)

### Admission Points Score (APS) Planning
**APS Calculation**: Best 6 subjects (excluding Life Orientation)
- 7 points: 80-100%
- 6 points: 70-79%
- 5 points: 60-69%
- 4 points: 50-59%
- 3 points: 40-49%
- 2 points: 30-39%
- 1 point: 0-29%

**Maximum APS**: 42 points
**Typical University Requirements**:
- **Competitive Programs**: 35-42 APS (Medicine, Engineering, Law)
- **Standard Programs**: 28-34 APS (Most degrees)
- **Access Programs**: 24-27 APS (Foundation/bridging programs)

### Grade 11 Mark Targets Based on Grade 10 Performance
**If Grade 10 average was 60%**: Target 65-70% in Grade 11
**If Grade 10 average was 70%**: Target 75-80% in Grade 11
**If Grade 10 average was 80%**: Target 80-85% in Grade 11
