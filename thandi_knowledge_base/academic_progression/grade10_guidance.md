# Grade 10 Student Guidance - Academic Progression

## Overview
Grade 10 marks the beginning of the Senior Phase (Grades 10-12) in South Africa under both CAPS and IEB curricula. This is a critical transition year where students move from the Intermediate Phase to more specialized subject choices that will determine their career paths.

## Academic Context
- **Phase**: First year of Senior Phase (Grades 10-12)
- **Curriculum**: CAPS (Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement) or IEB (Independent Examinations Board)
- **Status**: New student in Senior Phase system
- **Available Marks**: None yet - this is your foundation year
- **Subject Selection**: Made in Grade 9, now implementing choices
- **Duration**: Full academic year to establish academic foundation

## Key Characteristics of Grade 10 Students

### Academic Status
- **New to Senior Phase**: First exposure to specialized subjects under CAPS/IEB
- **No Previous Marks**: Cannot use marks-based guidance yet
- **Subject Exploration**: Learning about chosen subjects in depth
- **Foundation Building**: Establishing study habits and academic routines

### Career Guidance Focus
1. **Career Exploration**: Broad exploration of career options
2. **Subject Selection Confirmation**: Ensuring current subjects align with interests
3. **Study Habit Development**: Building effective learning strategies
4. **Academic Foundation Building**: Establishing strong knowledge base

## Subject Requirements (CAPS/IEB Grades 10-12)

### CAPS (NSC) Subject Requirements
**Compulsory Subjects (4)**:
1. **Home Language** - One of 11 official SA languages
2. **First Additional Language** - Different from Home Language  
3. **Mathematics OR Mathematical Literacy** - Choose one (critical decision)
4. **Life Orientation** - Not examined at NSC level

**Elective Subjects (Choose 3)**:

## Critical Subject Decisions

### Mathematics vs Mathematical Literacy
**This is the most important decision for Grade 10 students:**

**Mathematics (Core Math)**:
- Required for: Engineering, Physical Sciences, Architecture, Medicine, Actuarial Science
- Opens doors to: STEM careers, high-demand technical fields
- Challenge level: High, but essential for technical careers
- University requirement: Most science and engineering programs

**Mathematical Literacy**:
- Suitable for: Commerce, Humanities, Social Sciences, Arts
- Focus: Practical math applications, financial literacy
- Challenge level: More accessible, practical approach
- Limitation: Cannot take Physical Sciences, limits STEM options

### Subject Combination Constraints
- **Physical Sciences requires Mathematics** (not Mathematical Literacy)
- **Subject combinations must be viable** (minimum 15 learners per combination)
- **Timetable considerations** - subjects cannot clash
- **School resources** - not all schools offer all subjects
