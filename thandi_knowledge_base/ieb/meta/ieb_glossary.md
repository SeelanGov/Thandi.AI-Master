- **Further Studies**: Advanced programmes in Mathematics and English (formerly Advanced Programme). A-level equivalent, requires 70%+ prerequisite.

- **AP**: Advanced Programme - Former name for Further Studies programmes.

- **A-Level Equivalent**: International recognition level of Further Studies programmes for overseas university applications.

## Assessment Terms

- **SBA**: School-Based Assessment - 25% of final mark (same as CAPS), but with flexible components designed by individual schools.

- **Continuous Assessment**: IEB emphasis on ongoing evaluation throughout the year, not just final exams.

- **Moderation**: IEB process ensuring consistent standards across different schools.

- **School Flexibility**: IEB schools' ability to customize teaching methods and assessment design within CAPS framework.

- **Enrichment**: Additional activities and deeper content beyond minimum CAPS requirements.

## Subject Strategy Terms

- **8th Subject**: Additional subject beyond the required 7, can boost APS by 3-4 points.

- **9th Subject**: Second additional subject, further APS boost potential.

- **APS Boost**: Additional Admission Point Score gained from extra subjects (3-7 points possible).

- **Subject Combination Strategy**: Selecting subjects to maximize APS and university preparation.

## Financial Terms

- **School Fees**: Annual tuition costs for IEB schools (typically R50K-200K+).

- **Additional Levies**: Extra costs for facilities, technology, excursions beyond basic fees.

- **Bursary**: Financial aid offered by some IEB schools based on merit or need.

- **Further Studies Fees**: Additional costs for Advanced Programme subjects.

## Application Terms

- **Entrance Exam**: Assessment some IEB schools require for admission.

- **Application Deadline**: Early application dates for IEB schools (often Grade 8 for Grade 9 entry).

- **Waiting List**: Reserve list for oversubscribed IEB schools.

- **School Interview**: Personal assessment as part of IEB school admission process.

## University Preparation Terms

- **University Readiness**: Enhanced preparation for higher education through IEB methodology.

- **International Recognition**: IEB qualification acceptance by overseas universities.

- **Critical Thinking**: Enhanced analytical skills emphasized in IEB assessment.

- **Independent Learning**: Self-directed study skills developed through IEB approach.

## Common Confusions Clarified

- **IEB vs CAPS NSC**: Same certificate, same university recognition. IEB = private school pathway, CAPS = public school pathway.

- **25% vs 60% Assessment**: IEB uses 25% SBA + 75% exam (same as CAPS). The 60/40 split only applies to Further Studies programmes.

- **Cost vs Value**: IEB fees are significant (R50K-200K+) but may provide APS boost and better university preparation.

- **Further Studies vs Regular Subjects**: Further Studies are additional advanced programmes, not replacements for core subjects.

## Quality Assurance Terms

- **Accreditation**: IEB's official recognition by Umalusi to conduct NSC examinations.

- **Standards Moderation**: Process ensuring IEB maintains equivalent standards to CAPS.

- **External Verification**: Independent checks on IEB assessment quality and consistency.

## School Categories

- **Model C Schools**: Former government schools, now private, often using IEB.

- **Private Schools**: Independent institutions choosing IEB assessment.

- **International Schools**: Schools offering IEB alongside international curricula.

- **Dual-Medium Schools**: IEB schools offering instruction in multiple languages.

## Assessment Levels (Same as CAPS)

- **Level 7**: 80-100% (Outstanding) = 7 APS points
- **Level 6**: 70-79% (Meritorious) = 6 APS points
- **Level 5**: 60-69% (Substantial) = 5 APS points
- **Level 4**: 50-59% (Adequate) = 4 APS points
- **Level 3**: 40-49% (Moderate) = 3 APS points
- **Level 2**: 30-39% (Elementary) = 2 APS points
- **Level 1**: 0-29% (Not achieved) = 1 APS point

## Strategic Planning Terms

- **APS Optimization**: Using 8th/9th subjects strategically to maximize university admission points.

- **Career Pathway Alignment**: Selecting IEB subjects that support intended university programs.

- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Weighing IEB fees against potential academic and APS advantages.

## Student Success Tips

- **8th Subject Strategy**: Choose additional subject in area of strength for guaranteed APS boost
- **Further Studies Planning**: Apply early - limited places available
- **Fee Planning**: Budget for 4 years of fees plus additional costs
- **University Advantage**: Leverage IEB's enhanced university preparation
