# CAPS (Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement) Overview

## What is CAPS?

CAPS is a single, comprehensive, and concise policy document implemented by the Department of Basic Education (DBE) in South Africa. It replaces previous Subject and Learning Area Statements, Learning Programme Guidelines, and Subject Assessment Guidelines for Grades R-12. CAPS forms part of the National Curriculum Statement (NCS) Grades R-12, which outlines learning and teaching policies in public schools.

## Purpose

To provide a standardized framework for curriculum delivery, assessment, and promotion across South African schools, ensuring equity and quality education leading to the National Senior Certificate (NSC).

## Key Features

- **Standardized Nationally**: Uniform curriculum across all public schools, with implementation support varying by province.
- **7 Subjects**: Students must take exactly 7 subjects (4 compulsory: Home Language at 40%+, First Additional Language, Mathematics or Mathematical Literacy, Life Orientation; 3 electives).
- **Assessment Model**: 25% School-Based Assessment (SBA) including tests, assignments, practicals; 75% final external exam for most subjects in Grades 10-12.
- **NQF Level 4**: Completion of Grade 12 leads to NSC qualification, recognized for university entrance.
- **Promotion and Progression**: For FET phase (Grades 10-12), promotion requires 40% in Home Language, 40% in two other subjects, 30% in three subjects, and up to one fail (below 30%). Subject changes allowed in Grade 10 with approval, restricted thereafter.
- **Subject Selection Guidelines**: Choices finalized by end of Grade 9; electives based on career pathways (e.g., STEM: Physical Sciences, Mathematics).
- **Provincial Variations**: While curriculum is national, implementation differs (e.g., better resources in Western Cape metros; challenges in rural Limpopo; language support in KZN).

## Career Pathway Guidance

### STEM Pathways
- **Core Subjects**: Mathematics + Physical Sciences + Life Sciences
- **University Programs**: Engineering, Medicine, Computer Science, Architecture
- **APS Requirements**: Typically 35+ for Engineering, 40+ for Medicine

### Commerce Pathways  
- **Core Subjects**: Mathematics + Accounting + Business Studies/Economics
- **University Programs**: BCom, Business Management, Chartered Accountancy
- **APS Requirements**: Typically 30+ for BCom, 35+ for top programs

### Humanities Pathways
- **Core Subjects**: English HL + History + Geography
- **University Programs**: Law, Social Work, Teaching, Journalism
- **APS Requirements**: Typically 25+ for humanities, 35+ for Law

## CAPS vs IEB

While both lead to the same NSC certificate, key differences include:
- **CAPS**: Standardized nationally, 75% exam weighting, limited school flexibility
- **IEB**: School flexibility within framework, same 75% exam weighting, option for 8th/9th subjects
- **University Recognition**: Identical - both accepted equally by all SA universities

## Critical Decision Points

### Grade 10 (Final Opportunity)
- **Subject Changes**: Last chance to switch subjects (deadline: Term 1)
- **Mathematics vs Math Lit**: Critical decision - cannot switch after Grade 10
- **Science Subjects**: Must add Physical Sciences in Grade 10 for STEM pathways

### Grade 11-12 (Locked In)
- **No Subject Changes**: Curriculum locked from Grade 11
- **Focus on Performance**: Concentrate on improving marks for university applications
- **University Applications**: Begin researching and applying in Grade 12

## Common Student Questions

- "Can I switch from Math Lit to Mathematics in Grade 11?" → **No, not possible after Grade 10**
- "Do I need Physical Sciences for engineering?" → **Yes, essential for most programs**
- "What APS do I need for medicine?" → **Typically 40+ points (67% average)**
- "Can I change subjects in Grade 12?" → **No, subjects are locked from Grade 11**

## Resources and Support

- **DBE Website**: [education.gov.za](https://www.education.gov.za)
- **CAPS Documents**: Subject-specific curriculum statements available online
- **Provincial Support**: Contact provincial education departments for local guidance
- **School Counselors**: First point of contact for subject selection advice
