# CAPS Glossary of Terms

## Core CAPS Terms

- **CAPS**: Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement - National policy for school curriculum and assessment. Replaced previous fragmented policies in 2012.

- **DBE**: Department of Basic Education - Government body overseeing CAPS implementation and NSC certification.

- **NCS**: National Curriculum Statement - Overarching framework including CAPS for Grades R-12.

## Assessment Terms

- **SBA**: School-Based Assessment - 25% of final mark from internal tasks (tests, assignments, practicals). *Student tip: SBA marks are crucial - don't neglect them!*

- **PAT**: Practical Assessment Task - Hands-on components in subjects like Physical Sciences, Life Sciences, and IT. Required for practical subjects.

- **Moderation**: Process where external officials verify SBA marking standards across schools.

## Education Phases

- **FET**: Further Education and Training - Phase for Grades 10-12, leading to NSC qualification.

- **GET**: General Education and Training - Foundation phase (Grades R-9) before FET.

## Qualifications

- **NSC**: National Senior Certificate - Grade 12 qualification at NQF Level 4. Required for university entrance.

- **APS**: Admission Point Score - University entry calculation based on NSC results. Each subject percentage converts to points (30-39% = 2 points, 40-49% = 3 points, etc.).

- **NQF**: National Qualifications Framework - System classifying qualifications from Level 1 (Grade 9) to Level 10 (Doctorate).

## Language Requirements

- **HL**: Home Language - First language, requires 40%+ to pass. Compulsory subject.

- **FAL**: First Additional Language - Second language, requires 30%+ to pass. Compulsory subject.

- **SAL**: Second Additional Language - Optional third language.

## Subject Categories

- **CESM**: Classification of Educational Subject Matter - System categorizing subjects for university admission (e.g., Mathematics = CESM 10).

- **Life Orientation**: Compulsory subject covering life skills, career guidance, and citizenship. Does NOT count towards APS.

- **Mathematical Literacy**: Alternative to Mathematics, focuses on practical math applications. Limits STEM university options.

## Common Confusions Clarified

- **CAPS vs IEB**: Both lead to same NSC certificate. CAPS = public schools, IEB = private schools with more flexibility.

- **SBA vs Exam**: SBA = 25% (school tasks), Final Exam = 75% (external). Both essential for final mark.

- **APS vs Percentage**: APS converts percentages to points for university applications. 7 points = 80-100%, 6 points = 70-79%, etc.

- **Mathematics vs Math Lit**: Cannot switch after Grade 10. Mathematics opens STEM careers, Math Lit limits to humanities/business.

## Provincial Terms

- **WCED**: Western Cape Education Department - Provincial implementation of CAPS.

- **KZN DoE**: KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education - Provincial CAPS authority.

- **GDE**: Gauteng Department of Education - Provincial education authority.

## Related Systems

- **ABET**: Adult Basic Education and Training - Adult learning pathway parallel to school system.

- **TVET**: Technical and Vocational Education and Training - Post-school technical education colleges.

- **NSFAS**: National Student Financial Aid Scheme - University funding based on NSC results.

## Assessment Scales

- **Level 7**: 80-100% (Outstanding achievement)
- **Level 6**: 70-79% (Meritorious achievement) 
- **Level 5**: 60-69% (Substantial achievement)
- **Level 4**: 50-59% (Adequate achievement)
- **Level 3**: 40-49% (Moderate achievement)
- **Level 2**: 30-39% (Elementary achievement)
- **Level 1**: 0-29% (Not achieved)

## Student Success Tips

- **Grade 10**: Final chance for subject changes - choose wisely!
- **SBA Management**: Keep track of all SBA tasks - they count 25%
- **APS Planning**: Aim for Level 5+ (60%+) in all subjects for good university options
- **Subject Combinations**: Choose subjects that align with your career goals
