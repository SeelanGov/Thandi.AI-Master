## 📦 What We Built

### Session 1: Backend Integration (Last Chat)

- ✅ Guarded Client implementation
- ✅ LLM Adapter implementation
- ✅ API integration (all 4 blockers)
- ✅ Verification warning fix

### Session 2: Frontend Integration (This Chat)

- ✅ Response format fix
- ✅ End-to-end testing
- ✅ API layer verification
- ✅ Preflight preparation

## 🔒 Compliance Verified

**All 4 Blockers Working:**
1. ✅ Consent Gate - Hard-blocks without consent
2. ✅ POPIA Sanitiser - Strips PII before external calls
3. ✅ Guarded Client - 5s timeout + fallback
4. ✅ LLM Adapter - Vendor-agnostic interface

**Test Results:**
- Unit Tests: 4/4 PASS
- Integration Tests: 4/4 PASS
- UI Testing: PASS
- API Verification: PASS

## 🎓 What We Learned

**Frontend ≠ Backend:**
- UI screenshots don't prove compliance
- API layer must be independently verified
- Tests are the only proof that matters

**Integration Complexity:**
- Response field naming matters
- Timeout includes retry time
- End-to-end testing catches edge cases

**Documentation Value:**
- Proof documents enable deployment
- Checklists prevent mistakes
- Clear status enables decisions

## 💡 Key Takeaways

**For Deployment:**
1. Always verify API layer independently
2. Run automated tests before deploying
3. Have rollback plan ready
4. Monitor closely after deployment

**For Development:**
1. Build compliance from day 1
2. Test each blocker independently
3. Integrate incrementally
4. Document everything

**For Team:**
1. Frontend success ≠ backend success
2. Tests are proof, not screenshots
3. Compliance is non-negotiable
4. Documentation enables confidence
