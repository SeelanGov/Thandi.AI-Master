## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. UNIFIED CALENDAR SYSTEM (2026 onwards)

**Major Change**: South Africa has eliminated the staggered school calendar system.

**Previous System (2025 and earlier)**:
- Inland provinces (Gauteng, Free State, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, North West) started earlier
- Coastal provinces (KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Northern Cape) started later
- Created confusion and coordination challenges

**New System (2026 onwards)**:
- **All provinces start on same date**: 14 January 2026
- **All provinces end on same date**: 9 December 2026
- **Unified 4-term structure**: Consistent across entire country
- **200 school days**: Same for all schools
- **Official source**: Department of Basic Education (26 February 2025 announcement)

**Impact for Thandi**: 
- Simpler calendar implementation
- No provincial variations needed
- Easier for schools to trust and verify
- Professional, standardized approach
