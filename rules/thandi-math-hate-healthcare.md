# Rule #3: The "Math-Hate Healthcare" Rule

## Purpose
Prevent premature elimination of healthcare careers when students express math anxiety, while being honest about requirements.

## The Rule
**If student says they 'hate math', do NOT remove healthcare careers.**

Instead, show them with a soft warning:
```
⚠️ Note: This requires moderate math. Many succeed with tutoring. Verify requirements.
```

## Triggers
Student expresses math aversion through phrases like:
- "I hate math"
- "I'm bad at math"
- "Math is my worst subject"
- "I don't like math"
- "Math is too hard for me"
- "I struggle with math"

## Healthcare Careers Affected
This rule applies to careers that require math but are achievable with support:
- Nursing
- Pharmacy
- Physiotherapy
- Occupational Therapy
- Radiography
- Dietetics
- Biomedical Technology
- Medical Laboratory Science

## What NOT to Do
❌ Remove healthcare careers entirely from recommendations  
❌ Say "You can't do this without math"  
❌ Be discouraging about math requirements  
❌ Hide the math requirement  

## What TO Do
✅ Include the healthcare career in recommendations  
✅ Add the soft warning about math requirements  
✅ Mention tutoring/support as viable path  
✅ Encourage verification with institutions  
✅ Be honest but not discouraging  

## Implementation in Response

### Example Response Structure:
```
Based on your interests in helping people and science, here are careers to consider:

1. **Nursing (75% match)**
   Why: Strong fit for your caring nature and interest in health
   
   ⚠️ Note: This requires moderate math (dosage calculations, statistics). 
   Many students who struggle with math succeed with tutoring and extra support. 
   Verify requirements with nursing schools.
   
   Entry: Grade 12 with Life Sciences, minimum APS 28-32
   Salary: R15,000-R35,000/month
   
2. [Other careers...]
```

### Key Elements:
1. **Still recommend the career** (don't filter it out)
2. **Warning icon** (⚠️) to draw attention
3. **Specific math requirement** (dosage calculations, not just "math")
4. **Hope message** ("Many succeed with tutoring")
5. **Action item** ("Verify requirements")

## Why This Rule Exists

### The Founder's Story
This rule exists because of a real failure: A student who "hated math" was told they couldn't do nursing. They believed it and chose a different path. Years later, they discovered many nurses struggled with math initially but succeeded with support.

**The cost**: A lost career opportunity based on a fixable challenge.

### The Principle
Math anxiety ≠ Math inability

Students who say they "hate math" often mean:
- They haven't had good math teaching
- They're anxious about math tests
- They struggle with current math level
- They haven't found their math learning style

**None of these are permanent barriers to healthcare careers.**

## Testing Checklist

Before shipping, verify:
- [ ] Student says "I hate math" → Healthcare careers still appear
- [ ] Warning message appears on math-requiring careers
- [ ] Warning mentions tutoring as viable path
- [ ] Warning encourages verification
- [ ] Tone is honest but not discouraging
- [ ] Career is NOT removed from recommendations

## Edge Cases

### What if student says "I failed math"?
- Still show healthcare careers
- Add stronger warning: "This requires passing Math Literacy or Mathematics. Consider upgrading your math through adult education or bridging programmes."

### What if student has NO math subject?
- This is different from "hating math"
- Show healthcare careers that accept Math Literacy
- Be clear about which careers require Mathematics (not just Math Lit)

### What if student asks "Can I do nursing without math?"
- Be honest: "Nursing requires math for dosage calculations and patient care"
- But add: "Many nursing students who struggled with math in high school succeed with the focused, practical math taught in nursing programmes"
- Suggest: "Consider Math Literacy if you're not taking Mathematics"

## Success Metric
**Zero students eliminated from healthcare careers solely because they expressed math anxiety.**

If a student who "hates math" later becomes a successful nurse, this rule worked.
