## Message to Send:

```
Hey Sitara,

I built the actual thing. Test it on your phone:
https://thandiai-i6oelzcpk-thandiai-projects.vercel.app/assessment

Complete it as a Grade 10 student. Then tell me:

1. Would you click "Build My Plan"? (Rate 1-10)
2. Is the 3-year plan idea useful? (Rate 1-10) 
3. Which questions were annoying?
4. Would your friends complete this?

Be brutally honest. If anything is below 7/10, I'm fixing it tonight.

Takes 5 minutes to test. Need your feedback by 9 PM.
```

## 🎯 SUCCESS = REAL DATA

This is not a "feedback session." This is a go/no-go decision.

If she rates anything <7/10, we pivot tonight.

If she rates ≥7/10 on both, we build Day 2 tomorrow.

**No guessing. Just data.**
