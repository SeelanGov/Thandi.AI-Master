## 🎯 Current Mission: Week 1-2 Healthcare Foundation

### Goal
Close healthcare gap from 20% → 60% coverage

### Target Careers (Week 1)
1. ✅ **Physiotherapist** - Content created (5 chunks), ready to upload
2. 🚧 **Pharmacist** - Content partially created, needs completion
3. 🚧 **Mechanical vs Industrial Engineering** - Not started
4. 🚧 **Civil Engineering** - Not started
5. 🚧 **Professional Nursing** - Not started

### Files Status
- ✅ `thandi_knowledge_base/healthcare_careers/pharmacist_content.md` - Exists (partial)
- ✅ `scripts/upload-healthcare-content.js` - Fixed and ready
- ✅ Physiotherapy content - Embedded in upload script

---

## 🚨 Critical Knowledge Gaps

### High Priority (Week 1-2)
1. **Healthcare Careers** - 20% coverage
   - Need: Pharmacist, Nursing specializations, Dentistry
   - Impact: High student demand, critical shortage in SA

2. **Engineering Sub-fields** - 30% coverage
   - Need: Mechanical vs Industrial distinction, Civil Engineering
   - Impact: Student confusion, wrong career choices

### Medium Priority (Week 3-4)
3. **Creative Arts** - 10% coverage
   - Need: Film Production, Graphic Design, Music Production
   - Impact: Underserved student segment

4. **Trades & Artisan** - 15% coverage
   - Need: Electrician, Plumber, Welder, Automotive
   - Impact: Alternative pathways, high earning potential

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

### Today (November 13)
1. ✅ Fix upload-healthcare-content.js (DONE)
2. 🔄 Run upload script to add Physiotherapy content
3. 🔄 Generate embeddings for new chunks
4. 🔄 Test retrieval with healthcare queries

### This Week
1. Complete Pharmacist content (5 chunks)
2. Create Mechanical vs Industrial Engineering comparison (5 chunks)
3. Create Civil Engineering content (5 chunks)
4. Create Professional Nursing content (5 chunks)
5. Upload all content and generate embeddings
6. Test performance improvement (target: 50% → 60%)

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Week 1 Target
- **Chunks:** 634 → 659 (+25 chunks)
- **Healthcare Coverage:** 20% → 60%
- **Test Pass Rate:** 50% → 60%
- **Content Quality:** All modules meet Physiotherapy standard

### Quality Standards (Established)
- ✅ SA-specific context (companies, salaries, market data)
- ✅ Complete education pathways (all SA universities)
- ✅ Comprehensive funding (NSFAS + provincial + corporate)
- ✅ Actionable steps (Grade 11/12 specific plans)
- ✅ Expert-ready (validation framework prepared)

## 💡 Key Learnings

### What's Working
1. **Comprehensive content drives results** - 30K words → 86% pass rate
2. **Framework citation works** - Explicit framework names improve retrieval
3. **SA-specific context matters** - Local companies, salaries, bursaries essential
4. **Quality over quantity** - Deep modules outperform generic content

### What Needs Attention
1. **Subject-Career Matching** - 20% (needs specific career pathways)
2. **Financial Constraints** - 20% (needs TVET, part-time, learnerships)
3. **4IR Emerging** - 0% (needs cybersecurity, cloud, renewable energy)

## 🚀 Path Forward

### Focus: Knowledge Gap Remediation
- ❌ NOT building Student UI yet
- ✅ Completing healthcare foundation
- ✅ Systematic content build-out
- ✅ Expert validation preparation

### Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Healthcare + Engineering (25 chunks)
- **Week 3-4:** Creative Arts + Business (25 chunks)
- **Week 5-6:** Trades + Technical (25 chunks)
- **Week 7-8:** Emerging + Specialized (20 chunks)

### Resource Allocation
- **Content Creation:** 6 hours per career (research + writing + SA context)
