## ✅ CONTENT QUALITY VALIDATION

### SA-Specific Context ✅
- Local companies: Toyota, VW, Ford, SASOL, Eskom, Transnet, Anglo American
- ZAR salary ranges for all careers
- SA universities with ECSA accreditation
- Provincial and corporate bursaries
- PE registration requirements and benefits
- Scarce skills context

### Key Differentiators ✅
- **Mechanical vs Civil:** Moving parts vs static structures
- **Electrical Renewable Focus:** Loadshedding opportunity, REIPPP program
- **Chemical SASOL Premium:** 20-30% above market
- **Software No Physics:** Opens doors for pure maths students
- **Civil EGD Advantage:** 10-15% admission preference

### Strategic Highlights ✅
- **Renewable Energy:** Electrical and Mechanical focus on wind/solar
- **Green Hydrogen:** Chemical engineering R300B investment
- **Remote Work:** Software engineering USD earnings while living in SA
- **SASOL Dominance:** Chemical engineering bursaries and employment
- **Infrastructure Boom:** Civil engineering R800B government fund

## 🎯 UPLOAD STRATEGY

### Approach: Systematic Career-by-Career
Due to content volume (25 chunks, ~20,000 words), upload in batches:

**Batch 1:** Mechanical Engineer (5 chunks)
**Batch 2:** Electrical Engineer (5 chunks)
**Batch 3:** Civil Engineer (5 chunks)
**Batch 4:** Chemical Engineer (5 chunks)
**Batch 5:** Software Engineer (5 chunks)

### Expected Results
- **Starting:** 979 chunks
- **After Engineering:** 1,004 chunks (+25)
- **Engineering Coverage:** 30% → 60%
- **Total Coverage:** 52% → 58%
