## Next Steps: Technical Integration

### Phase 1: JSON Conversion
1. Create parser script adapted from `simple-spec-parser.js` (Sprint 1.1)
2. Extract all 20 chunks with full content (~1800-2000 chars per chunk)
3. Generate `career_misconceptions.json` with proper metadata

### Phase 2: Embedding Generation
1. Run embedding generation script (adapted from `re-embed-decision-chunks.js`)
2. Generate 1536-dimensional vectors for all 20 chunks
3. Estimated cost: R0.03 (20 chunks × R0.0015 per chunk)

### Phase 3: Database Upload
1. Create or verify `career_misconceptions_framework` module in knowledge_modules table
2. Delete any existing misconceptions chunks (if any)
3. Upload 20 new chunks with embeddings to knowledge_chunks table

### Phase 4: Validation Testing
1. Run test suite on Q11-Q15: `node scripts/test-rag-suite.js`
2. Target: 3-4/5 pass rate (60-80%) on misconceptions questions
3. Expected overall improvement: 25% → 40-50% (5/20 → 8-10/20)

### Phase 5: Iteration (If Needed)
1. Analyze which questions still failing
2. Identify missing key points in responses
3. Surgically enhance specific chunks with missing content
4. Re-embed and re-test
