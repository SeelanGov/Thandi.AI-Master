## 🔧 TECHNICAL EXECUTION

### Scripts Created:
1. ✅ `scripts/upload-mechanical-engineer.js` - Working template
2. ✅ `scripts/upload-electrical-engineer.js` - Renewable energy focus
3. ✅ `scripts/upload-chemical-engineer.js` - SASOL/petrochemicals
4. ✅ `scripts/upload-software-engineer.js` - 4IR/remote work
5. ✅ `scripts/upload-civil-NEW.js` - Infrastructure/EGD focus
6. ✅ `scripts/system-status-report.js` - Comprehensive monitoring

### Upload Sequence:
```bash
node scripts/upload-mechanical-engineer.js  # 984 → 989 chunks
node scripts/upload-electrical-engineer.js  # 989 → 994 chunks (module created)
node scripts/upload-chemical-engineer.js    # 994 → 999 chunks
node scripts/upload-software-engineer.js    # 999 → 1004 chunks
node scripts/upload-mechanical-engineer.js  # 1004 → 1009 chunks (duplicate)
node scripts/upload-civil-NEW.js            # 1009 → 1014 chunks
```

### Issues Resolved:
- ❌ Initial `upload-civil-engineer.js` had silent failure
- ✅ Resolved by copying working template and modifying
- ✅ Created `upload-civil-NEW.js` as working version
