## 🎯 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Critical? |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Grade 10 opt-in rate | >60% | **YES** |
| Grade 11 completion | >80% | YES |
| "Would use for real" | >70% | YES |
| Bursaries shown (low-income) | 100% | **CRITICAL** |

**The One Metric That Matters:** Grade 10 opt-in rate > 60%

---

## ⚠️ Critical Success Reminders

### 1. The CTA Must Be Irresistible
Test BOTH versions with Sitara:
- A: "Want Your 3-Year Action Plan? (5 more minutes)"
- B: "See Your 3-Year Success Plan (5 min • Worth R50K+ in bursaries)"

### 2. Action Plans Must Be Hyper-Specific
❌ "Improve Math by Grade 12"  
✅ "Math: 55% → 70% by Dec 2026. Khan Academy 3x/week + peer study Saturdays."

### 3. The "Show Me the Money" Moment
For low-income students at Q5:
```
💰 Bursary Value When You Succeed:
- Sasol: R120,000/year × 4 years = R480,000
- NSFAS: R80,000/year × 4 years = R320,000
Total: R800,000+

This is achievable with your current marks + tutoring.
```

### 4. Sitara's Validation is Pass/Fail
Wednesday is a GO/NO-GO gate. If her scores are <7/10, don't proceed to Friday.

### 5. The Friday Test is Binary
SUCCESS = Ship Monday  
FAILURE = Fix over weekend or pivot

## 🎯 The Core Philosophy

**4 questions** = Tells students WHAT they could be  
**10 questions** = Tells them HOW to become it

**Grade 10:** Prove value first, then offer depth  
**Grade 11-12:** They need help NOW, give it immediately

**Rule #4 is non-negotiable:** Low-income students MUST see bursaries

---

## 🚨 What Could Go Wrong

### Risk 1: Sitara says "too long"
**Mitigation:** Reduce to 8 questions (remove Q7, Q9)

### Risk 2: Friends don't complete
**Mitigation:** Identify drop-off point, simplify

### Risk 3: Rule #4 doesn't work
**Mitigation:** Debug immediately, this is non-negotiable

### Risk 4: <60% opt-in rate
**Mitigation:** Fix CTA, extend sprint by 1 day

### Risk 5: Technical bugs
**Mitigation:** Day 4 is buffer for bug fixes
